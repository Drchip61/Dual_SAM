## Abstract

As an important pillar of underwater intelligence, Marine Animal Segmentation (MAS) involves segmenting animals within marine environments. Previous methods don't excel in extracting long-range contextual features and overlook the connectivity between pixels. Recently, Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers a universal framework for general segmentation tasks. Unfortunately, trained with natural images, SAM does not obtain the prior knowledge from marine images. In addition, the single-position prompt of SAM is very insufficient for prior guidance. To address these issues, we propose a novel learning framework, named Dual-SAM for high-performance MAS. To this end, we first introduce a dual structure with SAM's paradigm to enhance feature learning of marine images. Then, we propose a Multi-level Coupled Prompt (MCP) strategy to instruct comprehensive underwater prior information, and enhance the multi-level features of SAM's encoder with adapters. Subsequently, we design a Dilated Fusion Attention Module (DFAM) to progressively integrate multi-level features from SAM's encoder. With dual decoders, it generates pseudo-labels and achieves mutual supervision for harmonious feature representations. Finally, instead of directly predicting the masks of marine animals, we propose a Criss-Cross Connectivity Prediction (
C3P) paradigm to capture the inter-connectivity between pixels. It shows significant improvements over previous techniques. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method achieve state-of-the-art performances on five widely-used MAS datasets.
## Overview

* [**Dual-SAM**] is a novel learning framework for high performance Marine Animal Segmentation (MAS). The framework inherits the ability of SAM and adaptively incorporate prior knowledge of underwater scenarios.
